## Design


## Technical Approach
Design approach: This page chooses interactive map design style, tell people how frequent the TCP cyber-attack on AWS in US.

Technical method: Mapbox and JavaScript tools were utilised to create this visualisation page

## Dataset
This dataset is from Kaggle, archived by Jacobs & Bob Rudis
The AWS Honeypot  Database is an open-source database including information on cyber-attacks/attempts. The original data has 451,581 data points collected from 9:53pm on 3 March 2013 to 5:55am on 8 September 2013. In this visualization the data points which are in US were selected.

My purpose is to analyse Amazon Web Services (AWS) honeypot data for any trends and/or correlations that could possibly be used in predictive cyber threat vectors. I spent a lot of time looking for data sets and most of the ones I found had no documentation and the data was hard to interpret just from the file. This data is well formatted and straight forward.
